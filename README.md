# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs.The first player to score 10 points wins the game.
Pressing the space bar at the end will start a new game. Extra balls appear at different points, and to add an extra challenge for the winning team, the winning paddle will begin to shrink after they score more than 5 points.

## Setup

## Features

At different points depending on the score of the players, there will be different balls that are initiated into play. I also adjusted the paddles to have a smooth movement. The game ends with the first to score 10 points.
